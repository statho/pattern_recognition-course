Labs exercises for Pattern Recognition course of NTUA 


### Lab1: Visual recognition of handwritten digits 

In this work we implement and use several classifiers (Bayesian, NNR, SVM, Random Forest)
for the task of automatic visual recognition of handwritten digits 0-9 and compare their performance. 


### Lab2: Recognition of spoken digits 

In this work we experiment on a typical digit recognition system from speech data provided. We implement our system in Matlab according to the steps provided by the description of the exercise. The final result is quite remarkable as the evaluation of our model demonstrates estimable accuracy by using the HMM tool in Matlab. The training set is comprised by 15 speakers and the test set by 4 speakers. Each speaker is recorded saying outloud the digits from 1 to 9.


### Lab3: Speech Emotion Recognition

In this work we implement an automatic emotion recognition system which is dedicated to individual emotion classification of all the song files. For the steps 12-14 of the exersice we perform the evaluation in k-NN and Naive Bayes and also performed a PCA analysis of the features working on WEKA. For steps 15-17 we use exclusively WEKA classifiers and our scripts in order to acquire the relevant classification results. After that we compare our selected system for both activation and valence recognition task with an SVM based classifier system and features extracted automatically using Opensmile Toolkit.
